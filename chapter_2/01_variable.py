# in python we don't have to specify the variable type
a = "nauman"
a1 = 'rehman' # string can also be written in only sigle quote('')
a2 = '''mansoori''' # and also be written in triple quote(''' ''')
# and there is one more benefit in triple quote that we can make a multiline varible by it
ab = '''he
is a 
good 
boy'''
b = 664
c = 23.6
d = 'a' # it is also consider as string type
e = True # boolean variable
f = False # boolean variable
g = None # use for none datatype means not any kind of datatype
print(a,a1,a2,ab,b,c,d,e,f,g) # we can also print it by take different print() function for each variable
# and in the above way also it automatically give spaces between these variables while printing

print(type(ab)) # it prints the type of variable or we can say print the class name of which it is a member
